# Earthquake_Detection_Model
TremorWatch: Earthquake Precursor Detection System, presents a prototype system that continuously monitors real-time seismic waveform data from global stations and uses machine learning to detect potential P-wave precursors. By recognizing these early seismic signals, the system aims to provide a foundation for developing affordable and scalable.
